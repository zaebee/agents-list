### **Week 2: Technical Infrastructure** 
- **Mon-Tue**: Begin web UI development
- **Wed-Thu**: Start deployment strategy design
- **Fri**: Integration testing and validation

### **Week 3: Core Features**
- **Mon-Tue**: Complete web UI MVP
- **Wed-Thu**: Finalize deployment automation
- **Fri**: End-to-end testing

### **Week 4: Documentation & Polish**
- **Mon-Tue**: Complete onboarding documentation
- **Wed-Thu**: Finalize project scoping
- **Fri**: Phase 2A review and Phase 2B planning

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Business Metrics**
- ✅ Revenue model defined with clear pricing strategy
- ✅ Go-to-market plan with timeline and milestones
- ✅ Business case with ROI projections

### **Technical Metrics**
- ✅ Web UI deployed and accessible to users
- ✅ One-click deployment process established
- ✅ System can handle 100+ concurrent tasks
- ✅ 99%+ uptime in staging environment

### **User Experience Metrics**
- ✅ Non-CLI users can create and manage tasks via web UI
- ✅ Task assignment suggestions 90%+ accurate
- ✅ Average task creation time < 2 minutes
- ✅ Team onboarding time < 30 minutes

## 🔄 **Deferred to Phase 2B**

### **Complex Features** (4-6 week timeline)
- **AI Owner Sticker Enhancement** - Requires significant backend work
- **Advanced PM Agent Features** - Multi-agent orchestration workflows
- **Enterprise Integration** - Slack/Discord bots, GitHub integration

### **Rationale for Deferral**
1. **Focus on MVP**: Phase 2A prioritizes market-ready core functionality
2. **Resource Optimization**: Complex features require dedicated development cycles
3. **User Validation**: Phase 2A will provide user feedback to refine Phase 2B scope

## 💼 **Resource Allocation**

### **Agent Assignments (Optimized)**
- **business-analyst**: Monetization strategy (primary expertise)
- **frontend-developer**: Web UI development (specialized skills)
- **deployment-engineer**: Infrastructure automation (technical fit)
- **prompt-engineer**: Onboarding docs (better than business-analyst)
- **tutorial-engineer**: Project scoping (strategic documentation)

### **Total Effort Estimate**
- **Business Foundation**: 8 hours
- **Technical Infrastructure**: 24 hours (UI + Deployment)
- **Documentation**: 16 hours
- **Testing & Integration**: 12 hours
- **Total**: 60 hours (~1.5 sprints for team of 5)

## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
- **API Stability**: Ensure backend APIs are stable before UI development
- **Deployment Complexity**: Start with simple containerization, expand gradually
- **Integration Issues**: Allocate buffer time for system integration

### **Business Risks**
- **Market Timing**: Complete monetization strategy early to inform development
- **User Adoption**: Validate web UI with beta users before full launch
- **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize core features over nice-to-haves

## 🎯 **Phase 2A Success Definition**

**Phase 2A is successful when:**
1. ✅ Business model is defined and validated
2. ✅ System is deployable via simple process
3. ✅ Non-CLI users can use the system effectively
4. ✅ Team can onboard new members quickly
5. ✅ System handles production-level task loads

## 🚀 **Phase 2B Preview**

**Next Phase Focus** (Weeks 5-10):
- Advanced agent orchestration workflows
- Enterprise integration features
- Analytics and reporting dashboard
- Performance optimization at scale
- Community and ecosystem development
