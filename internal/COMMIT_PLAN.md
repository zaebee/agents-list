# Commit Plan - Conventional Commits

Following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for clean, semantic commit history.

## Commit Strategy

### 1. **feat: Add comprehensive CRM enhancements and AI agent selector**

**Files**: `our-crm-ai/crm_enhanced.py`, `our-crm-ai/agent_selector.py`, `our-crm-ai/crm_setup_enhanced.py`

```
feat: Add comprehensive CRM enhancements and AI agent selector

- Add AI-powered task routing with 400+ technical keywords
- Implement enhanced CRM CLI with rich formatting and categorization  
- Add intelligent agent selection with confidence scoring
- Support all 59 agents in CRM (vs previous 5 hardcoded agents)
- Add automatic agent discovery and setup capabilities

BREAKING CHANGE: None - backward compatible with existing CRM scripts

Closes: #<issue-number>
```

### 2. **feat: Add agent validation and tool restriction framework**

**Files**: `validate_agents.py`, `add_tool_restrictions.py`, `apply_tool_restrictions.py`

```
feat: Add agent validation and tool restriction framework

- Add comprehensive agent audit with model assignment validation
- Implement role-based tool access control system
- Add systematic tool restriction application framework
- Support security-focused agent configurations
- Add validation scripts for configuration consistency

Features:
- validate_agents.py: Model assignment and metadata auditing
- add_tool_restrictions.py: Systematic tool restriction framework
- apply_tool_restrictions.py: Sample implementation demonstrator
```

### 3. **fix: Correct agent naming and model distribution inconsistencies**

**Files**: `architect-reviewer.md` (renamed), `README.md`

```
fix: Correct agent naming and model distribution inconsistencies

- Rename architect-review.md to architect-reviewer.md for consistency
- Update agent count from 58 to 59 in documentation  
- Correct Sonnet model count from 36 to 37 agents
- Fix model assignment documentation discrepancies

This resolves configuration drift between documentation and implementation.
```

### 4. **feat: Add tool restrictions to agent configurations**

**Files**: `security-auditor.md`, `python-pro.md`, `frontend-developer.md`, `devops-troubleshooter.md`, `api-documenter.md`, `business-analyst.md`

```
feat: Add tool restrictions to agent configurations

Add role-based tool access controls for enhanced security:

- security-auditor: Analysis and web tools only (no execution)
- python-pro: Full development toolset including notebooks
- frontend-developer: Core development plus web research tools
- devops-troubleshooter: Complete access including process management
- api-documenter: Documentation-focused toolset
- business-analyst: Analysis and research tools

This establishes security boundaries while maintaining functionality.
```

### 5. **docs: Add comprehensive project alignment documentation**

**Files**: `ALIGNMENT_SUMMARY.md`, `PR_DESCRIPTION.md`, `README.md` updates

```
docs: Add comprehensive project alignment documentation

- Add ALIGNMENT_SUMMARY.md with detailed change documentation
- Update README.md with CRM integration and tool restrictions
- Add PR description following Google best practices
- Document new tool restriction security model
- Add setup and usage examples for enhanced features

Improves project maintainability and onboarding experience.
