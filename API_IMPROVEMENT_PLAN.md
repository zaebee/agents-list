# API Improvement Plan

This document outlines the plan to refactor and improve the AI-CRM API.

## 1. Objectives
- Migrate the API from Flask to FastAPI for improved performance, features, and documentation.
- Implement RESTful best practices for clear, predictable, and scalable API design.
- Enhance readability and maintainability for both human developers and AI agents.
- Ensure the API is robust, with proper error handling and data validation.

## 2. Plan

### 2.1. Migrate from Flask to FastAPI
- **Action:** Replace the Flask application with a FastAPI application.
- **Benefit:** FastAPI provides automatic data validation, serialization, and interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc).

### 2.2. Enhance Data Modeling (Pydantic)
- **Action:** Define all API data structures as Pydantic models in a dedicated `models.py` file. Add clear descriptions and example values to each model field.
- **Benefit:** This will make the data contracts explicit and dramatically improve the auto-generated OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation.

### 2.3. Refactor for Separation of Concerns
- **Action:** Separate the business logic from the API routing layer. The API endpoints in `api.py` will be responsible only for handling HTTP requests and responses. The core logic for interacting with YouGile will be moved to a dedicated `crm_service.py`.
- **Benefit:** This makes the code cleaner, easier to test, and allows different interfaces to reuse the same core logic.

### 2.4. Implement RESTful Best Practices
- **Action:** Review all endpoints to ensure they use the correct HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) and appropriate status codes (`200 OK`, `201 Created`, `404 Not Found`, etc.). Add clear `summary` and `description` tags to each endpoint for better documentation.
- **Benefit:** This makes the API predictable, standard, and self-documenting.

### 2.5. Implement Centralized Error Handling
- **Action:** Create a centralized exception handler. This will catch custom exceptions (e.g., `TaskNotFoundException`) and automatically convert them into standardized JSON error responses with the correct HTTP status code.
- **Benefit:** This removes repetitive error-handling code from the business logic and provides consistent, machine-readable error messages for API consumers.

### 2.6. Apply Code Style and Linting
- **Action:** After the refactoring, run `flake8` to ensure the code adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines and `black` to automatically format the code for consistency.
- **Benefit:** This ensures the code is clean, professional, and easy to read for any developer or AI agent.
