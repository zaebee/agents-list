## üéØ Agent Selection Strategies

### Automatic Selection

#### How the AI Chooses Agents

The system uses sophisticated analysis to match tasks with the most appropriate agents:

1. **Keyword Analysis** - Extracts technical terms and domain indicators
2. **Context Understanding** - Analyzes task complexity and requirements
3. **Specialization Matching** - Maps keywords to agent expertise areas
4. **Confidence Scoring** - Calculates match confidence (0-100%)
5. **Multi-Agent Detection** - Identifies tasks requiring multiple specialists

#### Selection Examples

**Development Tasks:**
```bash
# Input: "Fix React component performance issues"
# Analysis: Keywords "React", "component", "performance"
# Result: frontend-developer (85% confidence)

# Input: "Optimize PostgreSQL queries causing timeouts"
# Analysis: Keywords "PostgreSQL", "queries", "optimize"  
# Result: database-optimizer (95% confidence)

# Input: "Implement JWT authentication with refresh tokens"
# Analysis: Keywords "JWT", "authentication", "security"
# Result: security-auditor (90% confidence)
```

**Complex Project Analysis:**
```bash
# Input: "Build microservices architecture with monitoring"
# Analysis: Complex project, multiple domains
# Result: PM Gateway recommends workflow:
#   1. Architecture design ‚Üí backend-architect
#   2. Service implementation ‚Üí Multiple language specialists
#   3. Monitoring setup ‚Üí devops-troubleshooter
#   4. Security review ‚Üí security-auditor
```

### Manual Selection Strategies

#### When to Override AI Selection

**Domain Expertise Requirements:**
- Specific technology stack preferences
- Team skill development goals
- Workload balancing across agents
- Emergency response situations

**Example Override Scenarios:**
```bash
# AI suggests: python-pro
# Override to: golang-pro (team uses Go primarily)
python3 crm_enhanced.py create --title "Build API service" --owner golang-pro

# AI suggests: frontend-developer  
# Override to: ui-ux-designer (need design focus)
python3 crm_enhanced.py create --title "Improve user interface" --owner ui-ux-designer
```

#### Strategic Agent Selection

**For Learning and Development:**
- Assign tasks to agents with complementary skills
- Use code-reviewer for quality learning opportunities
- Engage docs-architect for documentation improvements
- Leverage architect-reviewer for system design learning

**For Quality Assurance:**
- Always include security-auditor for authentication tasks
- Use performance-engineer for optimization initiatives  
- Engage test-automator for comprehensive testing
- Include code-reviewer for critical code changes
