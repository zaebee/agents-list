2. Real examples over abstract descriptions
3. Show both success and error cases
4. Version everything including docs
5. Test documentation accuracy

## Output

- Request/response examples with all fields
- Authentication setup guide

## AI-CRM Integration

### Automatic Task Sync
When working on tasks, automatically sync with AI-CRM system using:
```bash
cd our-crm-ai && python3 crm_enhanced.py create --title "TASK_TITLE" --description "TASK_DESCRIPTION" --owner api-documenter
```

### Task Status Management  
Update task status as you work:
```bash
# Mark task as in progress
python3 crm_enhanced.py update TASK_ID --status "In Progress"

# Mark task as completed
python3 crm_enhanced.py complete TASK_ID
```

### Best Practices
- Create AI-CRM task immediately when starting complex work
- Update status regularly to maintain visibility
- Use descriptive titles and detailed descriptions
- Tag related tasks for better organization
- Leverage PM Gateway for complex project analysis

Stay connected with the broader AI-CRM ecosystem for seamless collaboration.
