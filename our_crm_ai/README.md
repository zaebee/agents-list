# Our CRM AI - Proof of Concept

This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a command-line interface (CLI) based CRM that uses the YouGile API as a backend. It was created to facilitate communication and task management between a user and an AI team.

## Files

- `crm_setup.py`: A one-time script to initialize the project structure in YouGile.
- `crm.py`: The main CLI tool for managing tasks.
- `config.json`: A configuration file that stores the IDs of the YouGile project, board, and columns. (Generated by `crm_setup.py`)
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies for this project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Set Environment Variable:**
    This tool requires a YouGile API key. You need to set it as an environment variable named `YOUGILE_API_KEY`.

    On Linux/macOS:
    ```bash
    export YOUGILE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

    On Windows:
    ```powershell
    $env:YOUGILE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
    Replace `"your_api_key_here"` with the key you generated from your YouGile account.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `our-crm-ai` directory and install the required Python libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run Initial Setup:**
    Before using the CRM, you need to run the setup script once to create the project structure in YouGile.
    ```bash
    python crm_setup.py
    ```
    This will create a new project called "AI Team Communication", a board called "AI Team Tasks", and the necessary columns. It will also create the `config.json` file.

## Usage Instructions

All commands are run using the `crm.py` script.

### Create a Task
Creates a new task in the "To Do" column. You can optionally assign an AI agent as the owner.

**Command:**
```bash
python crm.py create --title "<task_title>" --description "<task_description>" [--owner <agent_name>]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Create a task without an owner
python crm.py create --title "Review new feature" --description "Review the latest code submission for the AI owner feature."

# Create a task and assign an owner
python crm.py create --title "Design MCP for Agent Communication" --owner "api-documenter"
```

### Update a Task
Updates an existing task. Currently, this only supports changing the AI Owner.

**Command:**
```bash
python crm.py update <task_id> --owner <new_agent_name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
python crm.py update 3a9286d6-9a26-4bca-b902-776eb41856fa --owner "ai-engineer"
```

### List Tasks
Lists all tasks on the board, showing their ID, title, and current status.

**Command:**
```bash
python crm.py list
```

### View a Task
Shows the detailed description and all comments for a specific task.

**Command:**
```bash
python crm.py view <task_id>
```

**Example:**
```bash
python crm.py view 1c261c8c-599e-4bfe-89dd-0d4bb3fb1b3e
```

### Comment on a Task
Adds a new comment to a task.

**Command:**
```bash
python crm.py comment <task_id> --message "<your_comment>"
```

**Example:**
```bash
python crm.py comment 1c261c8c-599e-4bfe-89dd-0d4bb3fb1b3e --message "I'll start working on this today. What is the preferred Python version?"
```

### Move a Task
Moves a task to a different column, changing its status.

**Command:**
```bash
python crm.py move <task_id> --column "<column_name>"
```
Available columns are "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".

**Example:**
```bash
python crm.py move 1c261c8c-599e-4bfe-89dd-0d4bb3fb1b3e --column "In Progress"
```
