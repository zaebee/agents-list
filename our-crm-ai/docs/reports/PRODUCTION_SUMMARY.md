- **Async execution** with retry logic and timeout handling
- **Performance monitoring** and cost tracking
- **Health checks** and failover mechanisms
- **Task routing** based on agent specialization

#### 5. Production Infrastructure ✅
- **Docker containerization** with multi-stage builds
- **Docker Compose** for complete environment orchestration
- **Nginx reverse proxy** with SSL termination and rate limiting
- **Redis** for caching and session storage
- **Monitoring stack** (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)

#### 6. Comprehensive Monitoring ✅
- **Prometheus metrics** collection for all components
- **Health check endpoints** for load balancer integration
- **Business metrics** tracking (projects, ROI, agent performance)
- **System resource monitoring** (CPU, memory, disk)
- **Log aggregation** with structured logging
