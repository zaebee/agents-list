## Overview
This PR completes the transition from YouGile integration to a PostgreSQL-based system with comprehensive authentication, code quality standards, and production-ready deployment.

## Commit Structure

### 1. Core Infrastructure 
```
feat(database): Implement PostgreSQL authentication system

- Add comprehensive user authentication with JWT tokens
- Implement role-based access control (USER, MANAGER, ADMIN)
- Add subscription tiers (FREE, PRO, ENTERPRISE) with feature gating
- Create database models for users, sessions, and audit logging
- Include Argon2 password hashing for security
- Add database migration and seeding scripts

BREAKING CHANGE: Removes YouGile dependency, now uses PostgreSQL
```

### 2. Code Quality Standards
```
feat(tooling): Add comprehensive code quality configuration

- Configure ruff with Google/PEP8 style guidelines
- Set up mypy for type checking with gradual typing
- Add black for consistent code formatting
- Configure pytest with coverage reporting
- Add pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks
- Include isort for import sorting

Resolves 481 linting issues and establishes development standards
```

### 3. Production Deployment
```
feat(docker): Add production-ready containerization

- Create multi-stage Docker builds with security hardening
- Add comprehensive docker-compose for all services
- Include PostgreSQL, Redis, and monitoring stack
- Configure nginx with SSL/TLS support

## Recommended Approach

Use the **single comprehensive commit** approach since this represents a major system overhaul that's difficult to break into smaller meaningful commits without creating non-functional intermediate states.
