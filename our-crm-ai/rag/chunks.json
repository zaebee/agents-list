        "Complexity (Haiku)**: Simple tasks like basic data analysis, documentation generation, and standard responses\n- **Medium Complexity (Sonnet)**: Development tasks, code review, testing, and standard engineering work  \n- **High Complexity (Opus)**: Critical tasks like security auditing, architecture review, incident response, and AI/ML engineering\n\nAvailable models (using simplified naming as of Claude Code v1.0.64):\n- `haiku` - Fast and cost-effective for simple tasks\n- `sonnet` - Balanced performance for most development work\n- `opus` - Most capable for complex analysis and critical tasks\n\nIf no model is specified, the subagent will use the system's default model.\n\n## Agent Orchestration Patterns\n\nClaude Code automatically coordinates agents using these common patterns:\n\n### Sequential Workflows\n```\nUser Request \u2192 Agent A \u2192 Agent B \u2192 Agent C \u2192 Result\n\nExample: \"Build a new API feature\"\nbackend-architect \u2192 frontend-developer \u2192 test-automator \u2192 security-auditor\n```\n\n### Parallel Executio",

        "**Subject: Onboarding Instructions for AI Teammate on the 'our-crm-ai' Project**\n\n**1. Your Role & Objective:**\n   - Your primary role is to be a specialized AI software engineer.\n   - Your objective is to complete development tasks assigned to you in our YouGile CRM. You will work collaboratively with other specialized AI agents.\n\n**2. Project Context:**\n   - You are working on the `our-crm-ai` project.\n   - All tasks are managed in our YouGile CRM.\n   - We have a command-line tool, `crm.py`, for interacting with the CRM. You will find it in the `our-crm-ai/` directory.\n   - The project team consists of several specialized AI agents (e.g., `frontend-developer`, `ai-engineer`, `api-documenter`). Each task has an assigned \"AI Owner\".\n\n**3. Your Workflow:**\n   - **Step 1: Fetch Your Assigned Task.**\n     - You will be given a Task ID from YouGile.\n     - Your first action is to use the `crm.py view <task_id>` command to get the full details of the task. This includes the title, descripti",
        " Task.**\n     - You will be given a Task ID from YouGile.\n     - Your first action is to use the `crm.py view <task_id>` command to get the full details of the task. This includes the title, description, AI Owner, and any existing comments or execution plans.\n\n   - **Step 2: Understand the Task and Your Role.**\n     - Read the task description and the execution plan carefully.\n     - Identify your role as the assigned \"AI Owner\". Your work should be guided by the capabilities defined in your corresponding `.md` file (e.g., `ai-engineer.md`).\n\n   - **Step 3: Formulate Your Plan.**\n     - Based on the high-level execution plan in the task comments, create your own detailed, step-by-step implementation plan.\n     - Use the `set_plan` tool to formalize your plan.\n\n   - **Step 4: Execute Your Plan.**\n     - Begin implementing your plan step-by-step.\n     - Use the available tools (`ls`, `read_file`, `create_file_with_block`, `run_in_bash_session`, etc.) to perform the work.\n\n   - **Step 5: ",

This keeps the whole team updated.\n\n   - **Step 6: Collaborate if Needed.**\n     - If a task requires expertise outside of your specialty (e.g., a backend task needs a frontend component), create a new sub-task in the CRM for the appropriate AI agent. Use `crm.py create --title \"...\" --owner \"frontend-developer\"` and add a comment linking it to the parent task.\n\n   - **Step 7: Finalize and Submit.**\n     - Once your implementation is complete and tested, use the `request_code_review()` tool.\n     - After addressing any feedback, use the `submit` tool to commit your work.\n     - Finally, move the tas",

        "# Our CRM AI - Proof of Concept\n\nThis project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a command-line interface (CLI) based CRM that uses the YouGile API as a backend. It was created to facilitate communication and task management between a user and an AI team.\n\n## Files\n\n- `crm_setup.py`: A one-time script to initialize the project structure in YouGile.\n- `crm.py`: The main CLI tool for managing tasks.\n- `config.json`: A configuration file that stores the IDs of the YouGile project, board, and columns. (Generated by `crm_setup.py`)\n- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies for this project.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.6+\n- pip\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n1.  **Set Environment Variable:**\n    This tool requires a YouGile API key. You need to set it as an environment variable named `YOUGILE_API_KEY`.\n\n    On Linux/macOS:\n    ```bash\n    export YOUGILE_API_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\"\n    ```\n\n    On Windows:\n    ```powershell\n    $env:YOUGILE_API_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\"\n    ```\n    Replace `\"",
        "API_KEY`.\n\n    On Linux/macOS:\n    ```bash\n    export YOUGILE_API_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\"\n    ```\n\n    On Windows:\n    ```powershell\n    $env:YOUGILE_API_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\"\n    ```\n    Replace `\"your_api_key_here\"` with the key you generated from your YouGile account.\n\n2.  **Install Dependencies:**\n    Navigate to the `our-crm-ai` directory and install the required Python libraries.\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n3.  **Run Initial Setup:**\n    Before using the CRM, you need to run the setup script once to create the project structure in YouGile.\n    ```bash\n    python crm_setup.py\n    ```\n    This will create a new project called \"AI Team Communication\", a board called \"AI Team Tasks\", and the necessary columns. It will also create the `config.json` file.\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\nAll commands are run using the `crm.py` script.\n\n### Create a Task\nCreates a new task in the \"To Do\" column. You can optionally assign an AI agent as the owner.\n\n**Command:**\n```b",

You can optionally assign an AI agent as the owner.\n\n**Command:**\n```bash\npython crm.py create --title \"<task_title>\" --description \"<task_description>\" [--owner <agent_name>]\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\n# Create a task without an owner\npython crm.py create --title \"Review new feature\" --description \"Review the latest code submission for the AI owner feature.\"\n\n# Create a task and assign an owner\npython crm.py create --title \"Design MCP for Agent Communication\" --owner \"api-documenter\"\n```\n\n### Update a Task\nUpdates an existing task. Currently, this only supports changing the AI Owner.\n\n**Command:**\n```bash\npython crm.py update <task_id> --owner <new_agent_name>\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```bash\npython crm.py update 3a9286d6-9a26-4bca-b902-776eb41856fa --owner \"ai-engineer\"\n```\n\n### List Tasks\nLists all tasks on the board, showing their ID, title, and current status.",

        "# Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized set of rules and data structures designed to facilitate clear, efficient, and context-aware communication between specialized AI agents working within the `our-crm-ai` project. Its primary purpose is to ensure that agents can seamlessly request actions, share task-related information, and report results without ambiguity.\n\nBy adhering to this protocol, we can build a robust system where each AI agent, regardless of its specific role (e.g., `frontend-developer`, `api-documenter`), can understand and act upon information provided by its peers.\n\n## 2. Core Principles\n\n- **Clarity and Explicitness:** All communication should be unambiguous. The intent of a message and the data it carries must be explicitly defined.\n- **Statelessness:** Whenever possible, requests between agents should be stateless. Each message should contain all the necessary context for the receiving agent to perform it",
        " be explicitly defined.\n- **Statelessness:** Whenever possible, requests between agents should be stateless. Each message should contain all the necessary context for the receiving agent to perform its task.\n- **JSON as the Standard:** All data structures within the MCP will be defined as JSON schemas for universal compatibility and ease of use.\n\n## 3. Communication Objects\n\nThe protocol is built around three core communication objects:\n\n1.  **`TaskContext`**: Represents the complete state and details of a specific task from the CRM.\n2.  **`AgentAction`**: Used by one agent to request a specific action from another.\n3.  **`AgentResponse`**: Used by an agent to send back the result of a requested action.\n\n---\n\n### 3.1. `TaskContext` Schema\n\nThis object encapsulates all relevant information about a task. It is used to provide a complete picture to an agent that needs to work on the task.\n\n**JSON Schema:**\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"taskId\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"",
        "about a task.
