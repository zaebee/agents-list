## Data Management

### Data Quality Framework

The training data manager implements a comprehensive quality framework:

#### Quality Scoring
```python
def calculate_data_quality_score(data_point):
    score = 0.0
    
    # Input quality (20 points)
    if len(input_text) >= 50: score += 20
    
    # Output quality (25 points)
    if meaningful_output(expected_output): score += 25
    
    # Context richness (15 points)
    score += min(len(context_keys) * 3, 15)
    
    # Domain relevance (20 points)
    if domain_relevant(agent_name, input_text): score += 20
    
    # Validation status (10 points)
    if validation_passed: score += 10
    
    # Performance score bonus (10 points)
    score += performance_score * 10
    
    return min(score / 100, 1.0)
```

#### Validation Rules

1. **Data Completeness**: Minimum required fields populated
2. **Privacy Compliance**: No sensitive information detection
3. **Domain Relevance**: Content matches agent specialization
4. **Quality Thresholds**: Minimum quality scores enforced
5. **Duplication Detection**: Content hash-based deduplication

### Data Augmentation

Automated data augmentation strategies:

- **Code Variation**: Generate alternative implementations
- **Error Injection**: Create debugging scenarios
- **Context Expansion**: Add related information
